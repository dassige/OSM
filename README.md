# FENZ OSM Manager

## Description

**FENZ OSM Manager** is a Node.js web application designed to streamline the tracking and management of expiring Operational Skills Maintenance (OSM) competencies.

It automates the process of checking a dashboard for expiring skills, persists data via a local SQLite database, and provides a secure web interface for administrators to send targeted email reminders. Unlike previous versions, this application manages all members, skills, and configurations dynamically via the web interface—no code editing required.

**Key Features:**

  * **Real-Time Web Dashboard:** A responsive UI using Socket.IO to view scraping progress, logs, and sending status in real-time.
  * **Database Driven:** All members and skills are stored in a local SQLite database (`fenz.db`).
  * **Multi-User System:**
      * **Super Admin:** A resilient system account defined via environment variables.
      * **User Management:** Create multiple database-backed administrators with secure password hashing.
      * **Automatic Notifications:** New users receive a welcome email with a randomly generated temporary password.
      * **Self-Service:** Users can manage their profiles and recover lost passwords via email.
  * **Web-Based Management:**
      * **Members:** Add, edit, delete, and CSV Import/Export members directly in the browser.
      * **Skills:** Configure which skills to track and mark them as Critical.
      * **Smart Form Links:** Define Google Form URLs with dynamic placeholders (e.g., `{{member-name}}`) to pre-fill member details automatically.
      * **Email Templates:** A rich-text editor with drag-and-drop variables to customize notifications for Expiring Skills, New Users, Password Resets, and Account Deletions.
  * **System Maintenance & Auditing:**
      * **Database Backup & Restore:** Download full database snapshots and restore them with strict version compatibility checks.
      * **Event Log:** A comprehensive audit trail recording all major actions.
      * **Log Maintenance:** Super Admins can prune old events, purge the entire log, or export it to JSON.
  * **Geoblocking Bypass:** Built-in proxy manager with support for **Fixed** (paid) and **Dynamic** (free) proxies.
  * **Cloud-Native Persistence:** Uses **Litestream** to replicate the SQLite database to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for stateless deployments (e.g., Google Cloud Run).
  * **Dockerized:** Ready for production deployment with a flexible configuration system.
  * **Demo Mode:** Run the application in a fully sandboxed environment using static local data and a separate database (`demo.db`). This allows for safe testing and demonstration without connecting to the live OSM Dashboard or risking production data.

## Prerequisites

  * **Node.js**: v20 or higher.
  * **npm**: Included with Node.js.
  * **Access**: Valid credentials for the OSM Dashboard you intend to scrape.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/dassige/OSM.git](https://github.com/dassige/OSM.git)
    cd OSM
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Prepare Configuration Files:**
    The application uses environment variables for sensitive data. Create your `.env` file from the example template:

    ```bash
    cp .example.env .env
    ```

## Configuration

The application is configured primarily via the **`.env`** file.

### Environment Variables (`.env`)

Open the `.env` file and configure the following parameters:

#### **Application Security (Super Admin)**

  * `APP_USERNAME`: The username for the immutable Super Admin (e.g., `admin`).
  * `APP_PASSWORD`: A strong password for the Super Admin.
  * `SESSION_SECRET`: A long, random string used to encrypt session cookies.

#### **Operation Mode**

  * `APP_MODE`: Set to `production` (default) for live scraping, or `demo` to enable the sandboxed demo mode.

#### **Demo Secrets (Only used when APP_MODE=demo)**

  * `DEMO_SUPERADMIN_USERNAME`: The username for the Super Admin in demo mode.
  * `DEMO_SUPERADMIN_PASSWORD`: The password for the Super Admin in demo mode.

#### **Application Settings**

  * `APP_TIMEZONE`: The timezone used for date calculations (e.g., `Pacific/Auckland`). Defaults to NZ time.
  * `APP_LOCALE`: The locale used for date/time formatting strings (e.g., `en-NZ`, `en-US`). Defaults to `en-NZ`.
    
#### **OSM Dashboard Connection**

  * `OSM_BU_ID`: **Crucial.** Your unique Business Unit ID (GUID) for the dashboard (e.g., `87FF646A-FCBC-49A1-9BAC-76F1C368EEFA`). The system will automatically construct the correct URL.
  * `DASHBOARD_URL`: (Optional) Override the automatic URL construction if you have a custom link.
  * `SCRAPING_INTERVAL`: Minutes to cache data before scraping the live site again (Default: `60`).

#### **Email Configuration (SMTP)**

  * `SMTP_SERVICE`: The service provider (e.g., `gmail`).
  * `SMTP_USER`: Your full email address.
  * `SMTP_PASS`: Your email password (or App Password).

#### **Proxy Configuration (Geoblocking Bypass)**

  * `PROXY_MODE`: Set to `none` (local NZ), `fixed` (paid proxy), or `dynamic` (free scraper).
  * `PROXY_URL`: Required if mode is `fixed`.

## Demo Mode

You can run the application in **Demo Mode** to test features or demonstrate the workflow without accessing live private data.

**How to Enable:**
1. Set `APP_MODE=demo` in your `.env` file.
2. (Optional) Set `DEMO_SUPERADMIN_USERNAME` and `DEMO_SUPERADMIN_PASSWORD`.

**Features in Demo Mode:**
* **Sandboxed Database:** Uses `demo.db` instead of `fenz.db` to ensure your real data is never touched.
* **Static Scraping:** Instead of connecting to the live OSM website, the app scrapes a local static HTML file located at `public/resources/demo_osm_dasboard.html`.
* **Dynamic Dates:** The system automatically adjusts the dates in the static file to appear current (relative to "today"), allowing you to test expiry logic effectively.
* **Visual Indicators:** A "DEMO VERSION" banner appears on all pages, providing a link to view the source HTML used for scraping.
* **Credential Reveal:** The login page includes a tool to reveal the demo Super Admin credentials for easy access.
## UI Customization

You can fully customize the look and feel (Logo, Background, Title).

### 1\. Customizing the Title

Change the `UI_LOGIN_TITLE` variable in your `.env` file:

```bash
UI_LOGIN_TITLE="Station 44 OSM Manager"
```

### 2\. Customizing Images (Local / Docker)

1.  Create a folder (e.g., `my-branding`) containing `logo.png` and `background.png`.
2.  Set `UI_RESOURCES_PATH=./my-branding` in your `.env`.
3.  Restart the application.

### 3\. Customizing Images (Cloud Run)

For stateless deployments, host your images publicly and provide the URLs via environment variables:

  * `UI_LOGO_URL`
  * `UI_BACKGROUND_URL`


## Usage

### 1\. Starting the Server

```bash
node server.js
```

*Listens on port **3000** by default.*

### 2\. User Management

  * **Super Admin:** Log in with the credentials defined in `.env`. Access **Manage Users** to create other admins.
  * **Creating Users:** When you add a user, the system generates a secure random password and emails it to them automatically.
  * **Deleting Users:** Deleting a user will also send them a notification email.

### 3\. Dashboard Workflow

1.  **Manage Members**: Import your team via CSV.
2.  **Manage Skills**:
      * Add skill names exactly as they appear on the OSM Dashboard.
      * **Templated URLs:** You can use variables in the "Form URL" field.
          * Example: `https://docs.google.com/forms/...?entry.123={{member-name}}`
          * The system will auto-fill the member's name and email when generating the link.
3.  **Email Templates**: Use the tabbed editor to customize the `Expiring Skills`, `New User`, `Password Reset`, and `Account Deleted` emails. Drag and drop variables directly into the text.
4.  **Event Log**: Use the yellow maintenance bar (Super Admin only) to prune old logs or purge the history.
5.  **Run Dashboard**: Click **Reload Expiring Skills** to fetch live data, then select members to send reminders.

## Docker Deployment

1.  **Build and Run:**
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d --build
    ```
2.  **Persistence:** The `docker-compose.yml` mounts the local directory to `/app`, ensuring your `fenz.db` persists restarts.

## Google Cloud Run Deployment

Supports stateless deployment using **Litestream** to replicate the database to Google Cloud Storage.

See [Installation on Google Cloud Run](Installation_google_run.md) for details.
